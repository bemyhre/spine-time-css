Not sure where this is going yet. Just a personal framework because bootstrap and foundation seems to be too much in many cases where pixel perfect is needed, but still would like an easy grid to work in that also perhaps has some of the offsetting items that normalize has. Probably my own way of investigating the css that already exists in these projects as well.

also, fuck gutters.
